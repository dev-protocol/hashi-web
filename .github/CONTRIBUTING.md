## Details on Contributing
### Contributing Scopes
When contributing to Hashi, it is important to keep in mind what a contributor can code and cannot code.

- Authoring new components are almost always left up to the internal team working on the design system.
- Code deviating from the specifications is NOT allowed. Follow the specifications in the design docs or in the `/specs` directory.

### Installing Dependencies
The current dependency list will always be compatible with the latest version of Hashi. However, the root directory, the tests and dev versions of the docs require the current in-development version of Hashi (aka the version you're working on). Not to fret, the directories mentioned have always linked their dependencies to the in-development version.

### Code Style
If you're worried about code style, we've provided an `.editorconfig` file for you to consume.
